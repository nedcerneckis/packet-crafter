# Packet Crafter

### This mini-project will explore the essence of the TCP/IP and UDP stack - how two devices talk to eachother under the hood

Our aim is to learn the following:

- TCP
- Packets
- UDP
- Sockets
- Signals that TCP sends
- Handshakes

With our main goal being:

```
Send "Hello World" from one peer to another peer.
```
